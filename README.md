The primary objective is to construct a model for predicting the probability of an individual defaulting on a loan. To achieve this goal, we will proceed through the following sequential steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing and Preparation:**
   In the initial phase, our focus will be on preparing and cleaning the dataset to ensure its readiness for analysis. This involves addressing missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring data consistency. Additionally, we will apply relevant data transformations and scaling techniques to enhance the overall quality of the dataset.

2. **Feature Engineering and Selection:**
   The second step involves improving the dataset by creating new features through engineering and selecting the most relevant features for model development. Feature engineering may include the creation of composite variables, while feature selection aims to identify the most impactful variables that significantly contribute to predicting loan default.

3. **Model Development and Evaluation:**
   In this phase, we will develop predictive models using various algorithms, such as machine learning and statistical models. These models will then undergo evaluation using appropriate metrics to assess their performance in predicting loan default. The evaluation process may involve techniques like cross-validation to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the model.

The dataset for this project is accessible through the following link: [https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset).

By following these systematic steps, the article aims to guide readers through the process of building an effective predictive model for assessing the probability of an individual defaulting on a loan. The provided dataset will serve as the foundation for exploring and implementing key concepts in data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection, and model development, ultimately leading to a comprehensive evaluation of the constructed models.
